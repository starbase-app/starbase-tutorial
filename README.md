# Starbase Tutorial

Welcome to your first code review in Starbase! This repository contains some simple Python code with a couple of bugs for you to find.

## How to Review

### 1. Look at the code

The review has already been started for you. You'll see the first commit in the file matrix. Click on a file to view its diff.

### 2. Add a comment

Found something worth mentioning? Click the **+** icon in the gutter next to any line in the diff. Type your comment and click **Post**. Comments are for observations, questions, or suggestions that don't necessarily need to be fixed.

### 3. Add a defect

Found a bug? Click the **+** icon in the gutter, check the **Defect** checkbox, describe the issue, and click **Post**. Defects are problems that the author must fix before the review can be approved.

### 4. Review the rework

After you file a defect, the author will fix the code and submit a rework. A new commit column will appear in the matrix. Click on it to see what changed.

### 5. Approve

Once you're satisfied that the bugs have been fixed, approve the review.
